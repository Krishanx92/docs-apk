In the modern digital-era, many organizations adopt digital transformation technologies to keep up with the changes. APIs are one of the basic building blocks used in a digitally-driven organization. When the number of APIs managed by the organization grows, they need to have an automated process to handle the rapid API development process. Having a proper continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) process would give an added advantage to your organization.

Integrating WSO2 APK into a CI/CD pipeline allows teams to automate the process of deploying, testing, and maintaining APIs on Kubernetes. This documentation will guide you through how to use WSO2 APK to automate the updating process of an API created in the cluster for different environments.
