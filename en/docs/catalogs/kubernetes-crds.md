# Kubernetes CRD Catalog

WSO2 API management for Kubernetees now offers comprehensive support for the [Kubernetes Gateway API specification](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/). This support signifies a significant advancement in our API management for Kubernetees solution, enhancing our compatibility and integration capabilities within Kubernetes environments.

WSO2 API management for Kubernetes also supports the [metaresources and policy attachment specifications](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/references/policy-attachment/#supported-resources) defined by the Kubernetes Gateway API. These specifications provide a standardized approach to extending and configuring the behavior of objects within the Gateway API.

The diagram below displays the CRDs used within the WSO2 API Platform for K8s.
